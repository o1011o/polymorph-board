# polymorph-board
An adjustable split ergo keyboard.

This keyboard is meant to make no compromises when it comes to the particular ergonomics of any given pair of hands. Every column including the thumb cluster can be moved along the x, y, and z axis and rotated about the z axis. The thumb cluster may also be rotated about the x axis and its height adjusted in relation to the finger columns. All that means that you can find your optimally relaxed hand position and set your keyboard to match that exactly. When your hand is perfectly at rest in the home row position every other key feels that much closer. 

The other stand-out feature of this keyboard is the particular stair-stepping of keys in their key well columns such that when a key is pressed it sits at the exact height of the un-pressed key in the row below it. With an optimized key map like Graphite most same finger bigrams start at a higher row and end on a lower one and that means you can slide from a pressed key to an unpressed one, making those bigrams much faster to type. In addition, this allows the keys to be closer together without running foul of their neighbors and that makes typing upper and lower row keys less taxing.

A wider finger base plate can be used if you want more than four columns.

You can see here how the upper row keys (on the left in this picture) are raised up such that when pressed they're even with the un-pressed row below them.

The thumb base plate is adjustable relative to the finger base plate. It can rotate about the x axis and move along the z axis. The thumb cluster itself can rotate about the z axis and move about the x and y.

The microcontroller and socket for communication between halves is here. This could use some revision but it works well enough. Pardon the poor print quality on the thumb cluster, that's the result of a worn out nozzle I didn't notice.

The bottom assembly is responsible for all the adjustment setting. When building the board you'll assemble everything unsoldered to get an estimate of the final shape then split the top and bottom and solder the top components in that shape plus a little slack to allow for further refinement.

Kailh hot swap sockets are glued in and diodes are soldered along the column instead of along the row as is more common. A better way to affix the sockets certainly exists and may be a point of further refinement but none of my prototypes were more effective or easier than glue. Again, pardon the poor print quality on the thumb.

Headers from the microcontroller extend down into the body of the board where jumpers can be plugged in. This is a satisfactory solution but the whole microcontroller housing may be redesigned if a better idea occurs to me. The pins from the trrs connector have short lead wires soldered to them and then those wires soldered onto jumpers that plug into the controller. The controller can be removed without desoldering anything in case you ever want to recover it.

A pair of smallrig arms hold the halves in place and their jaws grab onto this piece to help disribute their clamping pressure and keep them from sliding around. This is meant to grab onto the edge of a desk.
